# DM Bot
> *Name in progress

A DM toolset for manipulating responses from GPT-3.5+ and making AI-Assisted DMing easier. This app aims to act as both a place to set up and also to have running from the table to make content creation on the fly easy.

## Goals for the project:
- Statblock creation - ready and formatted statblocks as well as exportable data in a number of formats for use in external apps.
- DM Screen
    - Initiative tracker
    - Saved descriptions or statblocks
    - Saved names, items, locations, etc for the given session. Pull this stuff together quick and then expand on it later on.
- Regeneration on specific pieces - with the click of a button get a different character name, replace an items description, or beef up the CR and stats of an NPC.
